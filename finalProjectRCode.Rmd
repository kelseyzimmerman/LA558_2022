## Interactive Web Map Stuff

```{r}
library(leaflet)
library(ggmap)
library(sf)
library(rgdal)
library(geojsonsf)
library(tmap)
```

then...

```{r}
map1 <- leaflet(data = cds, options = leafletOptions(
                  # Set minZoom and dragging
  # dragging = false sets limit of screen
                    minZoom = 15, dragging = TRUE)) %>%
  addProviderTiles("OpenStreetMap") %>%
  setView(lng = -93.660,
  lat = 42.041,
  zoom = 16) %>%
  addPolygons(label = ~Name,
              stroke = FALSE,
              smoothFactor = 0.4,
              fillOpacity = 1,
              fillColor = "#de2d26",
              popup = ~Name)
```

omg

```{r}
#make marker
wmicon <- makeIcon("C:/Users/kelzi/Documents/ArcGIS/Projects/AmesChemLabDisposal/watertest.png",
                   iconWidth = 35,
                   iconHeight = 28,
                   iconAnchorX = 34,
                   iconAnchorY = 25)
```

```{r}
map2 <- leaflet(data = mwp, options = leafletOptions(
                  # Set minZoom and dragging
  # dragging = false sets limit of screen
                    minZoom = 14, dragging = TRUE)) %>%
  addProviderTiles("OpenStreetMap") %>%
  setView(lng = -93.660,
  lat = 42.041,
  zoom = 16) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(radius = 3,
                   label = ~Well_ID,
                   color = "##c51b8a",
                   weight = 4,
                   stroke = TRUE,
                   opacity = 0.9,
                   fill = TRUE,
                   fillColor = "#fa9fb5",
                   fillOpacity = 1,
                   popup = ~Well_ID)
# to save use maptools::mapshot
# mapshot(map2, "map2.html")
```

# to search tiles --

```{r}
# names(providers)
# TO SAVE GEOSPATIAL OBJECTS
## mwp <- rgdal::readOGR("C:/Users/kelzi/Documents/ArcGIS/Projects/AmesChemLabDisposal/monitoringWellPoints_Featu.geojson")
```

# change tiles

```{r}
#from Datacamp
# Print the providers list included in the leaflet library
providers

# Print only the names of the map tiles in the providers list 
names(providers)

# Use str_detect() to determine if the name of each provider tile contains the string "CartoDB"
str_detect(names(providers), "CartoDB")

# Use str_detect() to print only the provider tile names that include the string "CartoDB"
names(providers)[str_detect(names(providers), "CartoDB")]
```

Step 2

```{r}
# Change addTiles() to addProviderTiles() and set the provider argument to "CartoDB"
leaflet() %>% 
    addProviderTiles(provider = "CartoDB")
# remove data
m <- m  %>% 
        addMarkers(lng = dc_hq$lon, lat = dc_hq$lat) %>% 
        setView(lat = 50.9, lng = 4.7, zoom = 5)

m  %>% 
    clearMarkers() %>% 
    clearBounds()
# 
# The sector_label column in the ipeds data frame indicates whether a college is public, private, or for-profit. In the console, use the group_by() and the count() functions from the dplyr package to determine which sector of college is most common.
# 
# The tidyverse package, which includes dplyr, has been loaded for you. In your workspace, you also have access to the ipeds dataframe.
# Search data example
ipeds %>% group_by(sector_label) %>% count()
# Create a dataframe called `ca` with data on only colleges in California
ca <- ipeds %>%
        filter(state == "CA")

# Use `addMarkers` to plot all of the colleges in `ca` on the `m` leaflet map
map %>%
    addMarkers(lng = ca$lng, lat = ca$lat)
# Set the zoom level to 8 and store in the m object
map_zoom <-
    map %>%
    addMarkers(data = ca) %>%
     setView(lat = la_coords$lat, lng = la_coords$lon, zoom = 8)

map_zoom
# CSS colors: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp

# Make a color palette called pal for the values of `sector_label` using `colorFactor()`  
# Colors should be: "red", "blue", and "#9b4a11" for "Public", "Private", and "For-Profit" colleges, respectively
pal <- colorFactor(palette = c("red", "blue", "#9b4a11"), 
                   levels = c("Public", "Private", "For-Profit"))

# Add circle markers that color colleges using pal() and the values of sector_label
map2 <- 
    map %>% 
        addCircleMarkers(data = ca, radius = 2, 
                         color = ~pal(sector_label), 
                         label = ~paste0(name, " (", sector_label, ")"))

# Print map2
map2
```
Do not forget leaflet.extras package!
  We can add private colleges exactly how we added public colleges. Then using the addLayersControl() function with the overlayGroups argument we can give our users the ability to display public and/or private colleges. The overlayGroups argument takes a vector of groups that we have defined while creating our layers (i.e., public and private). As a reminder, here is how we can add public colleges to our map as a layer:
``` {r}
# Create data frame called public with only public colleges
public <- filter(ipeds, sector_label == "Public")  

# Add public colleges as a layer and save map as `m3`
m3 <- leaflet() %>% 
        addProviderTiles("CartoDB") %>% 
        addCircleMarkers(data = public, radius = 2, 
                         label = ~htmlEscape(name),
                         color = ~pal(sector_label),
                         group = "Public") %>% 
        addLayersControl(overlayGroups = c("Public"))
The htmltools library, color palette pal and the m3 map with public colleges have been loaded for you.
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. 4 When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#tmap stuff
bigShp <- readOGR("C:/Users/kelzi/Documents/ArcGIS/Projects/AmesChemLabDisposal/cds_geodaFIN.shp")
bigSF <- st_as_sf(bigShp)
```

```{r}
tmap_mode("view")
popEst <- tm_shape(bigSF) +
tm_polygons(col = "PopEst",
            alpha = 0.7,
            n = 5,
            style = "jenks",
            palette = "Purples",
            area = "Shape_Area",
            colorNA = NULL,
            title = "Estimated Population, 2020",
            id = "NAME",
            pop.vars = "NAME"
) +
  tm_layout(title = "Census Block Groups within 3 Miles of the Ames Chemical Disposal Site",
            title.size = 3,
            bg.color = "grey85",
            ) +
  tm_view(view.legend.position = c("right", "bottom")) +
  tm_basemap("OpenStreetMap")
```
```{r}
tmap_mode("view")
medianInc <- tm_shape(bigSF) +
  tm_polygons(col = "MedianInc",
            alpha = 0.7,
            n = 5,
            style = "jenks",
            palette = "Greens",
            area = "Shape_Area",
            colorNA = NULL,
            title = "Median Income, 2020",
            id = "NAME",
            pop.vars = "NAME"
) +
  tm_layout(title = "Census Block Groups within 3 Miles of the Ames Chemical Disposal Site",
            title.size = 3,
            bg.color = "grey85",
            ) +

  tm_view(view.legend.position = c("right", "bottom")) +
            tm_basemap("OpenStreetMap")

```


## Building a Better Pop-up
With the paste0() function and a few html tags, we can customize our popups. paste0() converts its arguments to characters and combines them into a single string without separating the arguments.

addCircleMarkers(popup = ~paste0(name,
                                 "<br/>",
                                 sector_label))
We can use the <br/> tag to create a line break to have each element appear on a separate line.

To distinguish different data elements, we can make the name of each college italics by wrapping the name variable in <i></i>

addCircleMarkers(popup = ~paste0("<i>",
                                 name,
                                 "</i>", 
                                 "<br/>", 
                                 sector_label))
                                 
# Use paste0 to add sector information to the label inside parentheses 
map %>% 
    addCircleMarkers(data = ca, radius = 2, label = ~paste0(name, " (", sector_label, ")"))
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
