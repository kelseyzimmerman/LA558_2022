A number of QLCS tornadoes were also experienced within the Highway 30 corridor. One of the most remarkable aspects of the derecho was the duration of severe winds, with many areas experiencing at least periodic, if not persistent, severe level (58+ mph) winds over a roughly 30 minute time frame. As the derecho moved eastward out of Iowa, it continued to expand, but weakened from its peak strength. Winds continued to exceed severe criteria (58+ mph) in Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Michigan and began to produce additional QLCS tornadoes across northern Illinois before fading out across northern Indiana and southern Michigan.||In the wake of the derecho, damage was substantial in many areas, rural and urban.

The second tornado caused damage in Oelwein (Fayette County) and locations southwest of the city. This tornado ripped an air handler unit off a restaurant and caused damage at the high school football stadium. This tornado was rated an EF-0.

The tornado had a very broad circulation with smaller vorticies embedded within the larger circulation.  The tornado produced mostly EF0 damage with some EF1 damage to houses on the far southwest side of town.  The remainder of the path was in agricultural fields to the south of town.  The tornado then moved from Tama county into Benton county.,"A surface low pressure system was centered over Kansas and Nebraska with attendant warm front draped across north central Iowa. This was bisected by an outflow boundary from morning convection across western Iowa. As morning activity exited the are the atmosphere quickly recovered steep low and mid level lapse rates exceeded 8 C/km with 0-6 km shear over 40 knots. Near the remnant outflow boundary 0-1 km SRH exceeded 150 m2/s2. Storms developed along this boundary and moved east along the warm front, spawning a number of tornadoes across the state. In fact, this is in the top 5 for tornadoes occurring in a single day for the state of Iowa since reliable records began in the 1980s. By evening convection congealed into an MCS, bringing heavy rain to portions of the state. A line of training storms set up north of the Des Moines metro, resulting in localized flash flooding.",55
